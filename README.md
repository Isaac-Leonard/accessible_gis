# Accessible GIS
A GUI application for working with GIS data for the blind
Note: This is extremely experimental and currently only intended for my own personal use
## How to run
This app requires gdal, nodejs and rustup to be installed.
Run
```
npm install
```
in the root directory
Run ```
npm install
```
in the static directory
Then run
```
npm run tauri dev
```
in the root directory and the app should open.
## Contributing
Pull requests and issues are very welcome however any added features must be 100% accessible with the MacOS voiceover screenreader and should preferably be accessible with any other screen reader.
